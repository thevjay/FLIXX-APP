Movie info application built with vanilla JavaScript that uses **version 3** of the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)

This includes the most populr movies and TV shows with detail pages, a search box for movies and shows with full pagination and a slider for movies that are currently playing in theaters. The slider uses the Swiper library.

## Theme (HTML & CSS)

Summarizes data: The code retrieves data about movies and shows from the TMDB API. It doesn't analyze the data to find trends or relationships, but rather focuses on presenting it in a clear and organized way.
Provides basic statistics: Functions like addCommasToNumber format numerical data (number of viewers) for better understanding, which is a basic statistical technique.
Focuses on "what is": The code primarily deals with what the data is, such as titles, descriptions, and ratings. It doesn't attempt to explain "why" things are the way they are or predict future trends.
Lays the groundwork for further analysis: By collecting and presenting information about movies and shows, this code lays the foundation for more advanced analysis.


The JavaScript functions in this project cater to various aspects of fetching, displaying, and managing data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. They enable seamless interaction with the application, starting from showcasing popular movies and TV shows to providing detailed information about individual titles. Functions like search facilitate user exploration by fetching relevant results, while others, such as pagination and alert display, enhance user experience. Additionally, features like background image overlay and loading spinner contribute to the aesthetic appeal and responsiveness of the application. Through careful implementation and integration, these functions ensure a smooth and engaging user journey, showcasing a proficiency in front-end development and API integration.
